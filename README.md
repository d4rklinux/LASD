# LASD

LASD Algorithms and data structure in C++ project for the Federico II University of Naples


## Description:

A set of dynamic data structures for generic types which includes :

    Container  
    Vector 
    List 
    Stack 
    Queue  
    Binary Tree 
    Binary Search Tree 
    HashTable 


The library has been developed using object oriented programming techniques and C++ as programming language in a linux envoironment. Thanks to template offered by C++ the data structures are independent from the type of the object stored inside, the user just have to specify it when instantiating. The library includes a simple user interface usefull for testing the code, thanks to a test battery given by Professor Fabio Mogavero. 

## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
make clean && make && ./main
```
